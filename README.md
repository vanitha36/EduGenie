# ER Diagram

## Overview

The Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) represents the logical database design of the EduGenie Learning Assistant. It illustrates the entities, their attributes, and the relationships required to support AI-powered educational services such as Question Answering, Concept Explanation, Quiz Generation, Text Summarization, and Personalized Learning Recommendations.

## Entities

The ER Diagram consists of six core entities:

- USER
- USER_QUERY
- AI_RESPONSE
- QUIZ
- SUMMARY
- LEARNING_PATH

## Relationships

- One USER can submit multiple USER_QUERY records.
- Each USER_QUERY generates one AI_RESPONSE.
- One USER_QUERY can generate multiple QUIZ records.
- One USER_QUERY can generate multiple SUMMARY records.
- One USER_QUERY can generate multiple LEARNING_PATH records.

## Database Design

The database follows proper normalization principles by separating users, educational requests, AI-generated responses, quizzes, summaries, and learning recommendations into individual entities. Primary and Foreign Keys maintain data integrity and support scalability.

## Future Scope

The ER design supports future enhancements including:

- User Authentication
- Student Progress Tracking
- Persistent Chat History
- Cloud Database Integration
- Multilingual Learning
- AI Analytics Dashboard
- Mobile Application Support
